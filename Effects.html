      <h2> Effects </h2>
      <p>
        Music has many different effects from connecting crowds' nationalism with national anthems, singing a hymn of an
        organization, courting with a love song, making a baby fall asleep to a lullaby. Music stimulates the brain to
        make it engage further in a idea or action.

        It also has the ability to make memories stick easier some day to day examples of this is the alphabet song, or
        the favorite song of a person. And with this effect it has been found to help treat some mental illnesses as it
        helps release hormones in the brain. These hormones control emotions like pleasure and stress, and may also
        effect other immunity hormones.

        And connectivity with people of the same interests with sharing and listening to what the other has to offer.
        And there even is a hormone that music can effect called oxytocin, a chemical that makes a person feel more
        connected to others.
