    There are 4 Properties of Music: Pitch, Length, Loudness, and Sound Quality. Pitch is the highness or lowness of sound which means the lower the pitch, the deeper the sound and the higher the pitch, the higher the sound. Length is the duration of a sound or composition, the sound would get quieter and quieter after making it in a few seconds. Loudness is the volume of the sound or composition, If the volume is high, it is loud and vice versa. Sound Quality is the clearness of the sound, if the sound quality is down, the sound will make someting like a <span  id="grey">static sound </span> and the higher it goes the clearer it gets.
<br>
<br>
Pitch in music changes the mood and depends on the gender. Sometimes when the pitch is too deep it will cause the audio to get distorted and <span id="green">glitch </span> while other times the audio is either fine or <span id="red">eerie/ demonic </span>. Then there is the opposite where the pitch is too high and it will be hard to listen to because it hurts the ears or it is understandable and can be either creepy or <span id="yellow" >angelic</span>. But the pitch can also depend on the gender of the person singing like girls usually have a higher pitched voice than boys and boys usually have a deeper pitched voice than girls. There are some cases that the gender and the pitch are complete opposites.
<br>
<br>
The length of the sound makes the audio sound different like if the sound is short, you can only hear the ini<span id="white">tial</span> note of the sound that was played and if the sound is long, you can hear the initial sound and a <span id="white">((</span><span id="yellow">ringing</span><span id="white">))</span> of that sound. On the other hand, the length of a composition would not affect the sound but how <span id="big">BIG</span> the entire thing is. Usually the length of compositions are like 3 to 5 minutes long but there are some that end earlier than that or end after that point. The normal and the shorter compositions are better than a looooong one since the long one would be repetitive and eventually get boring.
<br>
<br>
Loudness either loud or soft really only affects the volume of the music. The volume will get very deafening when it is too loud. When the volume is too soft, no one would hear a single sound or just silence. The perfect volume really depends on the user. If the perfect volume is not met in a group of people then it will be hard to agree on it.
<br>
<br>
Sound quality affects the way people hear the audio. The best sound quality depends on the situation. If someone is in a call, they would rather the sound quality to be <span id="yellow">as clear as day</span>. If someone on the other hand makes sound effects for movies, they would want it to go in the theme of the scene like <span id="grey">static on radios</span>. Most of the time the sound quality that is the best is the clearest one. The sound quality can be affected by tampering with the audio or the signal of the connection. Tanpering with the sound quality can result in anything while the signal only goes one way. If the signal is good, the audio is clear but if the signal is bad, the audio is mostly gibberish.
